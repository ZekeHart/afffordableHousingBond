# affordablehousing
This is the start of the affordable Housing for Durham website, which is part of Code for Durham. The map was derived from the d3 cartogram, at:

https://github.com/shawnbot/topogram,

and d3 vue examples at:

https://github.com/CorpGlory/d3vue,

with the addition of v-select vue app at:

https://sagalbot.github.io/vue-select/.

The data for the map was obtained from the NC OneMap at:

http://www.nconemap.com/ and from Durham Neighborhood Commpass at:

http://compass.durhamnc.gov/

For information on how to process these datasets go to the datahub data wrangling GitHub repository at:

https://github.com/codefordurham/datahub-dw

This application is currently configured to access data through a Django Rest Framework (DRF). For more information to setup the DRF for this project, go to the datahub-be GitHub repository at:
