        <h2 class='medium-title'>NC Communities Supporting Affordable Housing</h2>
        <p class='subtitle'>Durham is not the only city to take a stand in support of affordable housing that can positively the community as a whole. Three NC communities have also rallied support for affordable housing.</p>
        <h3 class='title'>Charlotte</h3>

            <li>Three financial institutions (Bank of America, Ally Financial, and Barings) added $70 million to the fund after voters passed the measure</li>
            <li>This shows that throwing public support behind projects can entice and incentivize private-sector companies to contribute to the cause of affordability for all</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class='title'>Wake County</h3>

            Impacts of Affordable Housing on Communities
        </h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p class='subtitle'>
            Research has shown that building and supporting affordable housing benefits entire communities, not just the direct recipients of affordable housing units.
        </p>
        <h4 class='title'>Economic Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Building 100 affordable housing units can create more than 120 jobs during construction</li>
            <li>After construction, these units can sustain 30 additional jobs</li>
            <li>Housing for employees of all pay ranges is a major factor for companies to locate in a new area and/or remain in an existing region</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class='title'>Improved Educational Outcomes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Building affordable housing areas has produced measurable, positive impacts on educational outcomes for low-income students</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class='title'>Reduced Civic Administrative Costs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reducing foreclosures and residential displacement saves governments and individual taxpayers money by reducing property maintenance costs, court and legal expenses, and social service provision</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class='title'>Impacts on Property Values</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rehabilitated existing affordable housing has been found to generally provide beneficial outcomes for neighboring property values</li>
            <li>New affordable housing has minimal impact on housing values when it is integrated into existing neighborhoods</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class='medium-title' id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>
