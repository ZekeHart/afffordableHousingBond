        <h2>Comparison With Other NC Cities</h2>
        <p>Just as Durham is not the only city that has seen dramatic population and rent increases, neither is Durham the only city to take a stand in support of affordable housing that can positively benefit many different communities. Other cities, counties, and towns in North Carolina have raised money and support for affordable housing that benefits communities at risk of displacement. By passing this bond, Durham would join the company of other diverse communities that support residents of all income levels.</p>
        <h3>Charlotte</h3>
        <p>According to WFAE, Charlotte’s public radio station, the Charlotte region’s population has grown by just over 2% per year since 2007. At the same time, the number of housing units has grown at just over 1.3% per year, leading to an increased housing affordability crisis. To address this, voters passed a $50 million bond in November, 2018, to bolster the Charlotte Housing Trust Fund. This $50 million bond was an increase from the $15 million bonds that the city has issued in the past. 
        After hearing about the public’s commitment to supporting affordable housing, three financial institutions (Bank of America, _____, and _____) added $70 million to the fund, showing that throwing public support behind projects can entice and incentivize private-sector companies to contribute to the cause of affordability for all.

        <h3>Wake County</h3>
        <p>In Wake County, there are almost 100,000 households that pay more than 30% of their monthly income in rent.  County officials suggest that they must build 56,000 affordable units just to meet current needs. Without intervention and given current migration trends, the deficit will increase to 150,000 units by 2035. 
        In light of these staggering figures, Wake County leaders backed nine affordable-housing developments in April, 2019. This $12.6 million commitment, the county’s largest financial commitment to affordable housing to-date, will help add nearly 1,000 affordable rental units to the market - but they recognize they have a long way to go.
        </p>
        <h3>Chapel Hill</h3>
        <p>In November, 2018, voters in Chapel Hill approved a $10 million affordable housing bond that will build 400 new affordable housing units and renovate or maintain another 300 existing units. Over 50% of Chapel Hill’s residents pay 30% of their income or more on housing. The bond was financed by a one cent per $100 in a property’s valuation.</p>

            Impacts of Affordable Housing on Communities
        </h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>
            Some might argue that affordable housing increases taxes on the wealthy to provide benefits for only the poor and disadvantaged. Despite this misguided impression, research has shown that building and supporting affordable housing can have many beneficial impacts for an entire community, not just the direct recipients of the affordable housing units.
        </p>
        <h4>Economic Benefits</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Building 100 affordable housing units through the LIHTC program can create more than 120 jobs, on average, during the project’s construction phase</li>
            <li>These 100 housing units can sustain 30 additional jobs in industries such as retail, healthcare, and local government after the units are constructed and occupied</li>
            <li>This rate of job creation is on par with building a comparable number of market-rate units</li>
            <li>Employers state that housing for employees of all pay ranges is a major factor for their decisions to locate in a new area and/or remain in an existing region</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Improved Educational Outcomes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Economic integration of public schools via building affordable housing in higher-income areas has, in some regions, demonstrated measurable, positive impacts on educational outcomes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Reduced Civic Administrative Costs</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Reducing foreclosures and residential displacement saves governments and individual taxpayers money by reducing property maintenance costs, court and legal expenses, and social service provision</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Impacts on Property Values</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Rehabilitated existing affordable housing has been found to generally provide beneficial outcomes for neighboring property values</li>
            <li>Studies have found that there are no changes in property values when new affordable housing is developed nearby if:</li>
            <ul>
            <li>Affordable housing is located in healthy and vibrant neighborhoods</li>
            <li>The structure of the affordable housing doesn’t change the quality or character of the neighborhood</li>
            <li>The management of affordable housing is responsive to problems and concerns</li>
            <li>Affordable housing is not clustered by itself in low-income areas</li>
        </ul>
        </ul>
        <h2 id='conclusion'>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            We stand at a crossroads of two futures: we can continue on the path we are on, letting market forces dictate the future of our city, or we can take a stand, embrace the diversity of Durham, and ensure a more just and economically vibrant future for everyone, regardless of how much you can pay in rent.
