        <h1>Durham Housing Bond Background</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In 2017, nearly half of all households in the Raleigh-Durham region spent 30% or more of their monthly income on rent or mortgage payments. If you’ve lived in Durham long enough, you’ve felt and seen the changes that come from rapidly rising rents: communities in flux, neighborhoods in transition.
 
        To address these changes, in February, 2019, Mayor Steve Schewel proposed a $95 million affordable housing bond, described in detail <a class='here' href="https://www.durhamaffordablehousingbond.com/">here</a>. 

        But numbers alone don’t tell the full story. To provide more context about why Durham needs this affordable housing bond, our group of volunteers rallied around the goal of gathering, analyzing, and publishing information that provides context for why the affordable housing bond is both necessary and good for our community. Through maps, accounts of other NC communities that have supported affordable housing, and research that has shown the benefits of building affordable housing, this website affirms that we, as a community, need to pass this bond if we care about the kind of Durham we are going to live in.

        </h2>
        <p id=''>Many news articles and reports tell us how many people are moving to Durham each month or the income of each new resident compared to current residents. But changes in population, income, and housing costs are not the same across all areas of Durham. The following maps invite you to explore changes in Durham’s population, income, and housing costs from 2010-2017.</p>
